@dev ToDo:

1. Implement Staking function for Verse instead of withdraw!
    * As rewards for staking are paid in Verse, implement function on page to swap them thru Verse into ETH
        1. Deposit proceeds into pools -> this will give you LP tokens and some APY profit %
        2. If you want to go further you can: Deposit LP tokens into Verse Farms for additional profits
        3. Alternatively you can buy some Verse Tokens and stake them using your proceeds
2. Write tests for contract
3. Start building front-end
4. Implement Space And Time solutions for event listeners
